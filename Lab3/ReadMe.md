These tasks were perfoermed in lab on PyCharm.

Task 1: Compose a program with a Study_Level class. Define the instance attributes of “type”
and “number of years” inside the class. The class should also have set_cgpa_criteria function.
After that create two base classesthat inherit the information from the Study_Level class and
they write a message showing the type, number of years, CGPA criteria, and some additional
information.

Task 2: Write a python function that takes a list as a parameter and then returns a tuple that
contains two sub-lists (one_list, two_list). One sub-list should contain the elements of even
indices and the other should contain the element of odd indices.

Task 3: Write a python program that defines three classes ABC, DEF, and XYZ. Each class
should have one common method PQR(). But, they should have different functions. By using
polymorphism to create a common interface, i.e., test() that takes any object and calls the
object’s PQR() method. Then pass the created objects in the test() function. 

Task 4: Define a “Refrigerator” class. Then use the __init__() method to save the selling
amount of Refrigerator in a private attribute.
a) Check and try to modify the value of the private attribute outside of the class. Check!
b) Then change the value of the private attribute by using a setter function that takes price
as a parameter

Task 5: Create an empty class.
